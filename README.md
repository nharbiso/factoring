# Factoring

I completed this project within my free time during sophomore year of high school - it determines the nature of any given multivariable expression and factors into its component parts! The currently supported factoring methods are:
- factoring multivariable binomials (e.g. $16x^8y^8 - 625z^4 = (4x^4y^4+25z^2)(2x^2y^2-5z)(2x^2y^2-5z)$)
- factoring multivariable expressions by grouping
- factoring single variable polynomials by the rational root theorem
- factoring multivariable quadratics
- factoring multivariable quartics into unfactorable quadratics
